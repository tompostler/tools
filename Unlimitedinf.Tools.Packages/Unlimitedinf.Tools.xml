3.2.2

  - Enhancements to Log.

3.2.0

  - Added Log to provide the custom logging that I tend to use across all my projects.

3.1.0

  - Added FileSystemCollection to enumerate files/directories with an enumerable that gracefully ignores exceptions thrown during usage.

3.0.7

  - Reuse the RNGCryptoServiceProvider in GenerateRandom for a security and performance increase.

3.0.6

  - Added in StringExtensions: ToBase64String, FromBase64String, Chop

3.0.5

  - Fixed a bug in TryParseRelativeDateTime that threw instead of returned false for above int.Max. Now will only throw for above long.MaxValue.

3.0.4

  - Added builds for net40, net45, net46, and latest.

3.0.3
      
  - Fixed a bug in String.TrypParseRelativeDateTime that could throw an ArgumentOutOfRangeException.
  - Added the String.GetHashCode* methods because they're easier to consume.
      
3.0.2
      
  - Added new String.GetHashCode extension.
      
3.0.1
      
  - Broke apart the original package based on dependencies.
